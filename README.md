# सुdhaar - Leading Cities to a Sustainable Future

![सुdhaar](/sudhaar.png)

## Short Description
### What's the problem?
According to the India water portal report (2019) by Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, around 360,000,000 litres of water go waste every day due to leakage and similar reasons in Bangalore. According to data from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF), around 10.8 lakh trees were illegally cut in India during 2016-19. Around 40% of plastic waste in India remains uncollected and littered on the streets, according to a study released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2019.<br>
While the UN has set the goal of Sustainable Cities and Communities - to make the cities sustainable, upgrade the living standards, create green spaces, and improve urban planning and management; problems such as water leakage and loss, illegal axing of trees, and unattended garbage dumping on roads pose a huge challenge to it. These issues need to be efficiently solved in order to achieve the goal.

### How can technology help?
People can register their complaints related to issues concerning common city standards- such as garbage disposal, water leakaage, greenery destruction, etc. - to their repective municipal authorities on the online portals that are easily accessible to all.

### The Idea
If the communicating mediums between the people and the administrating authorities is reduced, then there is a chance that identification of urban issues in cities will become easier. Providing an online platform that is simple to use and accessible just with a click, and which directly send complaints to the authorities, will aid the communication between peopleand the authorities.<br>
